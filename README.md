# Home Buyer Team (Local Preview)

This project is a static site, so you can preview it locally with the included `preview.js` helper. It starts a lightweight HTTP server on a port that is guaranteed to be free.

## How to preview

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed.
2. Run `node preview.js` from the project root.
3. The script prints the exact `http://localhost:<port>/` URL.
4. Visit that URL in your browser to explore the site.

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the preview server when you are done.
